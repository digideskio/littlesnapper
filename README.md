# littlesnapper

![](http://hakobaito.co.uk/content/01389892049828525366.png)


#### a tool to capture and print snapchat pictures to a connected inkless BERG Little Printer.

BERG Little Printer
<http://bergcloud.com/littleprinter/>

littlesnapper captures unread snapchat images, hosts the image for 45 seconds to allow the little printer to parse and print the image and then deletes it.  

littlesnapper's old name was *'whippersnapper'* 

note: due to the printer being a thermal printer, the images it will print will be black and white.

_yu wer expekting culurs rite?_

_srry._

## requirements

to run littlesnapper you would need:

-   php 5.1+

-   php-curl

-	php-gd

-   mcrypt

-   A BERG Little Printer

-   A local, hosted server or vps

(I've tried heroku and i'm working on it in the future.)

## how to use

Here is a democast
 
<a href="http://quick.as/7zoi4wg">http://quick.as/7zoi4wg</a>

first of all, install dependencies by typing: 

```composer install```

next, replace the following in the ```config.ini.php```

###snapchat config

```usr``` = your snapchat username. eg: Evan 

```pass``` = your snapchat password. eg: Ghostface

```delete``` = do you want to delete or keep captured snaps? eg: true

+ _In ALL cases this should be ```true``` as you do NOT need to keep images on your server._ 

```dither``` = image dithering options: ```true``` = dither, ```false``` = threshold


###littleprinter config

```api_key``` = your littleprinter API key.

```server_url``` = your servers root directory that littlesnapper is hosted on.

+ _[ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) is awesome to host local servers securely on the web._ 

```time_to_delete``` = the time you want to delete the image in seconds. eg 20

+	_if you type null or a strange value, littlesnapper defaults to 45 seconds._

_also, make sure your folder **permissions** are setup properly._

and now using php in the command-line, type:

    php littlesnapper.php
    
here's a few of mine.

It is possible to use cron jobs on a server for littlesnapper.

_(I ran into alot of permissions errors when using the cron job. Sometimes littesnapper will print a blank image.)_

_to try, use_

    crontab -e
    
_and enter the path to where php is (/usr/bin/php) & the directory to where littlesnapper is._

just don't turn it into a cron job disaster like mine was.

## future/todo

(in order of precedence)

<del>security<del>

<del>config file.<del>

<del>implement dithering algorithms (for shading)<del>

support for printing multiple snaps.

include more dithering features for configuration.
